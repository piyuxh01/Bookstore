# Bookstore - A Book Review Site with MongoDB Integration

For this site with a blindingly creative name, I wrote an Express web application where users could enter basic information
about a book (author, title, ISBN), and after sanitization, the data would be saved on a MongoDB database. The app also makes
use of automated slug generation to create a "book details" page for each book entry, and users can then further add reviews 
to these books which are posted to the respective details page.
